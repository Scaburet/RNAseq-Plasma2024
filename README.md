# RNAseq_Plasma

RNAseq analysis course materials for Magistere of Genetics M2 course, for building a docker environment on Plasmabio server at UPC.

This repository contains adapted Jupyter notebooks for RNAseq bioinformatic analysis, specifically designed for second-year Master's students in genetics.  
The course materials are structured in two parts:
 - Bash analysis pipeline for quality check, processing, mapping of RNAseq short reads and output checking
 - R analysis pipeline for downstream analysis of expression data
